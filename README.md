<h1>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h1>
<p>This project was developed by programate's students to improve the mentoring process, in programate´s bootcamp each student has a mentor, that is like a friend that give advices or just is your complement for resolve some question in your process into the bootcamp, but with same interests that you have.

This project was a legate from the before students in the same bootcamp, we improved and gived our styles for a beautifull result that teached us a lot of thinks in this enviroment, the development.
</br></br></p>

<h2>PROJECT OBJECT</h2>
<p> Improve and make fully functional the web application Mentoria Okhlos, which will facilitate and streamline the mentoring processes that involve; the assignment of mentors to students, the proper development of each mentoring session with the record of what was discussed in it and the monitoring by the administrative staff to the entire process. Okhlos seeks to automate this entire process, since each of the roles involved: students, mentors and administrative staff, currently perform this process manually and, seeing the growth of students, carrying out the process in this way will take more time than estimated.</br></p> 

    
<h2>Our process to build this project was</h2>

<p>We created a board on Trello https://trello.com/b/miucJlV9/okhlos to assigned task daily</p>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
