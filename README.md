<h1>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h1>

<h2>PROJECT OBJECT</h2>
<p> Improve and make fully functional the web application Mentoria Okhlos, which will facilitate and streamline the mentoring processes that involve; the assignment of mentors to students, the proper development of each mentoring session with the record of what was discussed in it and the monitoring by the administrative staff to the entire process. Okhlos seeks to automate this entire process, since each of the roles involved: students, mentors and administrative staff, currently perform this process manually and, seeing the growth of students, carrying out the process in this way will take more time than estimated.</br></p>
